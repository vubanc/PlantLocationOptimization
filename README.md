# SupplyChainOptimization
In this project, a linear programming optimization model was formulated to select the optimum locations for opening production plants for a hypothetical business. The dummy dataset contains a set of parameters for the 5 locations namely, USA, Germany, Japan, Brazil and India. The parameters include: 
- Variable cost of production ($/unit).
- Variable cost of transportation ($/unit).
- Fixed cost of opening a plant at each of the locations.
- Capacity of production plant at each of the locations.
- Demand at each of the locations.

The linear programming model finds the optimum locations for opening the plants with the objective of minimizing cost while fulfilling the capacity and demand constraints.
